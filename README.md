# CancerLevelPrediction

Many people's lives are cut short due to cancer. However, with the progress of big data, we are able to combat this malicious disease.
The dataset contains 25 columns in total, where the input data includes Cancer Patient's details like age, gender,lifestyle habits, and health conditions and the output dataset includes level or stage of cancer in the patient ---> LOW[early-stage]
                                                     MEDIUM[curable]
                                                     HIGH[immediate treatment]
                                                     
The Aim here is to predict the stage of cancer in the patient based on various factors.
This ML model could be integrated with chatbots where people will input their information which will in turn predict the results accordingly.
